# Lab 3  
  I decided to record videos again but this time I recored several short videos so that I can imbed them into GitHub.
Otherwise the videos will be too large and can't be imbedded.

## cd   
$ cd ~/iot  
$ cd *3

## Packets  
  Before I kept going, I neede to download the packets with pip.  
First get pip

Then install the packets

It has also occured to me that I could have been using the 'tab' key a bit more so that I didn't have to type so much...

You live and you learn.

## Time  
$ python3 time_example.py

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534623/154885703-654063e5-b5c9-4c6c-a0d7-c59744ad8847.mp4

## Sun & Moon  
$ python3 sun.py 'New York'  
$ python3 moon.py

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534623/154885708-20996c9b-2c4f-40a5-9df6-d3c0dabdeda6.mp4

## Coordinates & Address  
$ python3 coordinates.py 'SC Williams Library'  
$ python3 address.py '40.74480675, -74.02532862031404'

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534623/154885882-a155cc1b-82d2-4250-8c74-454bb04f4430.mp4

I was having troubles with these commands. Some of the places that I tried wouldn't return the same place
when I put the coordinates into "address.py". Although I did get the inputs to work with some other places.

I also checked the python code.

## CPU & Battery  
$ python3 cpu.py  
$ python3 battery.py

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534623/154886165-f16a767c-f576-4745-9612-8c5111a6348f.mp4

I missed recording myself using "battery.py" but it didn't detect any batteries. It is also in the next video.

## Document  
$ python3 documentstats.py document.txt

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70534623/154886175-f1e5d4f5-3419-4b49-84ee-1604ce7cbd15.mp4

I wanted to try making my own test file so I did.

## Extra

This lab was also when I found that you just need to add two spaces at the end of a line for effectly '\n'

So this line is seperated in the raw file right HE
RE but you can't tell

You can tell that it is HE  
RE because there are two places after 'HE  '
