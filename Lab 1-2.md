# Lab 1-2 Progress

## Lab 1
First I had to get my Raspberry Pi working. I had set it up in a previous class but I could nolonger ssh to it because I had reset my laptop. So I went through the steps
explained in 'lab 1' from the IoT repository. I clicked the link below to and followed the instructions.

  [How to Set Up a Headless Raspberry Pi, Without Ever Attaching a Monitor](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html)

While folling the steps, I coudn't conect to my Pi with Putty. This is because in my appartment one of my suitmates already had a pi set up, and it coudn't find mine
specificaly (although this was also when I mistyped my network, so the Pi wasn't even connected to a network). I then tried to use a monitor setup to connect the Pi
but I didn't have a keyboard. Ultimatly, I used the monitor just to find the IP address then used Putty with the IP to ssh. I was then able to enable VNC and no
other problems came up

## Lab 2
For this lab I was confused. We we're not given any circuitry to work with so much of lab 2 or at least Lesson 2 was uncompletable. So Then I just did what was instructed
on the 'ECE-322-2' slides. I recorded a video of of me inputting all the commands into the command promt on my VNC of my pi.
